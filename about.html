				<p> Hi! I'm Sarah, a rising junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science & Conservation and Resource Studies.</p>

				<p>This summer, I am redesigning the developer experience at <a href="https://www.trustedkey.com/">Trusted Key</a>, a startup that provides secure digital identity solutions using blockchain.</p>

				<p> During the semester, I am an associate consultant with <a href="https://beacn.berkeley.edu/">BEACN</a>, the premier environmental and corporate consulting club at UC Berkeley. Additionally, I collaborated with <a href="https://www.switchboardaudio.com/">Switchboard</a>, a cross-platform app that utilizes voice communication to help teams work effectively, to develop their Android designs as UX Product Manager for <a href="https://www.mobiledevsberkeley.org/">Mobile Developers of Berkeley</a>.</p>

				<p>As a designer, what never ceases to amaze me is the concept of degrees of separation and how close knit humanity is. My goal is to create products that create empathy while generating compassion and social movement. I strive to bring these elements together in my projects.</p>

				<p>In my spare time, you can find me tiramisu tasting, exploring the abundant nature in the Bay Area, and going on spontaneous adventures. I enjoy discussing everything from design to the most recent episodes of The Good Place. I would love to talk over a cup of coffee so definitely reach out!</p>

<!-- 	<p>My name is Sarah Tang and I am currently a second year student at UC Berkeley working towards a double major in Computer Science & Conservation & Resource Studies, an interdisciplinary major where I can create my own course of study centered around my interests in natural resources, sustainable design, and technology. My passion lies in designing to create a sustainable impact. </p>

	<p>I am excited to continue learning about product development and user experience. A product must be fun and easy to use, intuitive, easy to pick up for a new user, logical and simple. Otherwise, even if it has the best features, it won’t be used or adopted. I am enthusiastic about interaction design and user experience because it is tailored to the individual. The best part about being a designer is that I get to put myself in the user’s shoes, and think about how to integrate technical features with creating a great user experience.</p> -->

	<!-- <h3 align="middle"> Why I Love UX Design </h3>

	<p>Human centered design is about creating a relationship between people and their passions and developing links to products that puts users first. I am passionate about helping people connect to businesses and products because people have real needs. They have time constraints, but they also need information. User experience is about helping people meet their needs for products and information, quickly and easily, in a way that creates an amazing experience. And at the same time, while designers are constantly working with the user, we are also at the forefront of technology, learning about potential ways to apply new tech to current problems. We get to continuously push the boundaries of what tech can do.</p>

	<p>I am excited to connect people to what matters most because being a designer means taking an approach that is people-first and user-centric. What matters to people are their friends, the communities they belong to, their schools, their organizations, their churches, and their families. It includes the charities they support and their values and political beliefs. By determining what problems are important to people and the ideas they have as solutions to those problems, we can share with others, bring people together, and rally around solutions that make the world a better place. As designers, we have a responsibility to raise awareness and resources for worthy causes.</p>

	<p>I strive to connect people, their values, and technology to construct products and experiences that create true connections. I am curious about technology as well as people: their behavior, actions and state of mind. At the same time, I like to make order out of what is chaotic and broken. This means breaking down and re-assembling a product to create something more meaningful and beautiful. At the core, human beings are social beings. Our lives are about connecting to the things that are important to us, but also about sharing those things with each other.</p>
