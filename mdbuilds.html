		<h2>Logo Design</h2>

			<h4>DURATION: november 2017
		</div>

		<p>Mobile Developers of Berkeley, UC Berkeley's premier mobile incubator, rebranded as one of the steps towards becoming an app development agency. As a result, I was tasked with creating a new logo for the agency: MDBuilds.</p>

		<h3>PROBLEMS</h3>
		<!-- Questions, issues -->

		My task was to create a new logo for MDBuilds that incorporated the idea of mobile development within the restraints of our previous logo design and colors. We wanted a logo that illustrated the hard working efforts of the club yet still maintained a connection with the previous brand.


		<h3>IDEAS</h3>
		<!-- Solution -->
		Android Studio uses a hammer button for compiling and "building" the app. So, my idea was to use a hammer and incorporate it into one of the letters in "MDB" so as to maintain the name of the agency. Additionally, I also thought about putting the hammer inside of a phone to convey that we build apps.


		<h3>PROCESS</h3>
		<!-- Wireframes, lowfi, hifi designs -->
		<!-- Solutions in application (visual) hifi!! -->

		<p>The final logo was created after a first round of sketching to figure out how I would incorporate the hammer into the already existing MDB logo. After deciding on putting the hammer into a letter, I played around with either using the "D" or the "B". Ultimately, I decided on the "B" because it transitioned perfectly into the "Builds" portion.</p>

		<p>The next step was to figure out coloring as well as the font for the "uilds". I decided on a simple sans serif so as to play up the "MDB" portion, with the "uilds" being secondary. I used the same colors as the previous logo and created the hammer in the phone similar to the paw print.</p>

		<h3>TAKEAWAYS</h3>
		<!-- as well as other considerations -->
		This project was a good way to transition into logo design as it was a reiteration of a previous logo. In branding, I learned to understand and emanate the core principles and values of the club as well as make sure the point got across to the client. Especially for a brand that is not widely known, it is important to start of with typography and avoid only using an icon. These principles in terms of logo creation and branding set my foundation and will be useful in the future!
