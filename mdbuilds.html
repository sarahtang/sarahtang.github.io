			<h4>SCOPE: college club logo</h4>
			<h4>ROLE: logo design and creation</h4>
			<h4>DURATION: november 2017
		</div>

		<p>Mobile Developers of Berkeley, UC Berkeley's premier mobile incubator, rebranded as one of the steps towards becoming an app development agency. As a result, I was tasked with creating a new logo for the agency: MDBuilds.</p>

		</div>

		<h3>PROBLEMS</h3>
		<!-- Questions, issues -->

		My task was to create a new logo for MDBuilds that incorporated the idea of mobile development within the restraints of our previous logo design and colors. We wanted a logo that illustrated the hard working efforts of the club yet still maintained a connection with the previous brand.
