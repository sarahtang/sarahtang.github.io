				<h3>The Problem</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>Right now, the cleantech industry is one of the largest recipients of venture captial, contributing to the rapid increase in jobs among cleantech startups. Students are entering cleantech fields like environmental architecture, engineering, law, and policy. However, there is a need for cleantech job search engines to help match the increasing number of students with industry opportunities. The current cleantech job search process is frustrating, time-consuming, and intimidating. The goal of this project was to improve the job search process so that both students and employers have a more efficient experience while catering to the needs of their careers and companies respectively.</p>

				<h3>User Research</h3>

			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<!-- <h4>Add image of survey here</h4> -->

				<p>I created a "Cleantech Job Search Survey" in order to understand student's job process, the resources they used, their search engine preferences, and what features of job search engines they value most. I distributed the google form to a wide range of Berkeley environmental clubs as well as across California universities such as Stanford, UC Berkeley, Scripps, and CalTech. In total, I received more than 100 responses!</p>

				<h3>Research Insights</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>Based on the surveys that I conducted as well as the work of my teammates interviewing both students and companies, I came up with various insights:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Students demonstrated high interest in the cleantech industry but with relatively low experience, many not knowing where to start searching for a job. Approximately 70% of students were interested in finding summer internships and 57% of students were looking for research opportunities. Nevertheless, more than half of the survey respondents spend between 0-3 hours job searching. </li>
					<p></p>
					<li>Survey respondents were looking for job opportunities in a wide range of fields from engineering to business, software and data science, and product design and law. No category was greater than 25% and 20% of students were unsure of what they wanted to do, yet sitll expressed interest in cleantech.</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>Some of the pain points that students found were that there was no clear starting point for the job search process and it was intimidating applying to large companies or that they had either incompatible skills or no interest in available jobs. Moreover, most received few responses from recruiters and had no personal contact or visibility. There was also a lack of a centralized platform and location for cleantech related jobs.</li>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p> [Give context about why working on this project]</p>

			<h3>Current Implementation</h3>

			<h3>Diverging ideas</h3>
			<p>Project scope:
			Questions to be answered include: 1. what is the job search process and most desired jobs of the target users? what resources can be provided to make talent hunting process easier for cleantech companies? How do we attract more users? ==> determine this through students' survey and interview results as well as company interviews resutls, recommendations</p>

			<p>Potential ideas is looking at new advanced features and implementation with website, creating a mentorship program that will help to attract participatns</p>

			<p> PERSONALIZED JOB BOARD </p>



<p>My solution should serve as a guide for the job search process, include a wide range of opportunities, and be efficient by incorporating features such as easy filtering and favoriting to limit time spend searching for jobs.</p>

<p>Strong interest in cleantech as a whole, need to source from a wide range of industries and provide other resources (ex: mentorship)</p>

<p>Other diverging ideas: mentorship program with young professionals to ask questions about getting experience, what the industry is like, what to highlight on resume = understand career trajectory and get advice. Also resources like resume reviews, networking opportunties.</p>





			<h3>The Research</h3>
			<p>Asking people about their job search process and what they use/want</p>
			<p>[Detail process and show survey, number of people surveyed and from where]</p>
			<p>[Add screenshots of survey questions asked?]</p>

			<p>In order to answer these questions, split project by learning from students side by conducting surveys and leading individual interviews with representative students. Additionally also conducted industry analysis by comparing general job board engines, niche industry websites and learning from company POV with HR interviews.</p>

			<p>Survey methodology (for students)= include information on slide</p>

			<h3>Research Insights</h3>
			<p>Include information on slides</p>

			<p>People that I worked with provided insights about students and companies by synthesizing individual interview responses as well as other teammates that helped synthesize company needs (through HR interviews). Include info on slide about interview methodology here</p>
