				<p> For 12 weeks during the spring semester of 2018, I had the opportunity to do user research for 
				<a href="http://www.cleantechrising.com/">Cleantech Rising,</a>
				a company focused on encouraging a clean future by helping young professionals get into the cleantech industry. During my time on this project, <b>I worked to improve the job board website by conducting user analysis, distributing surveys</b>, and working with my team: Tom, Jia, Ansel, Arun, and Mei.</p>

				<h3>The Problem</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>Right now, the cleantech industry is one of the largest recipients of venture captial, contributing to the rapid increase in jobs among cleantech startups. Students are entering cleantech fields like environmental architecture, engineering, law, and policy. However, there is a need for cleantech job search engines to help match the increasing number of students with industry opportunities. <b>The current cleantech job search process is frustrating, time-consuming, and intimidating. The goal of this project was to improve the job search process so that both students and employers have a more efficient experience while catering to the needs of their careers and companies respectively</b>.</p>

				<h3>User Research</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>Going into the research, I wanted to understand both the employer and employee hiring process. Some of the questions that I had are listed below.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>On the student side:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>How do you search for jobs?</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>What types of resources would be helpful for breaking into the industry?</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>What other career websites have you used? What features do you value the most? Which are the most helpful and why?</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>And on the employer side:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>What types of roles do you hire for? Have you encountered recurring issues with applicants?</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>What job boards do you use and how often do you hire through them?</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>What are some pressing needs that a partnership with universities or a third-party organization could address?</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
		</div>

			

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>In order to answer these questions, we split the project and leanred the students point of view by conducting surveys and leading individual interviews with representative students. Additionally, we also conducted industry analysis by comparing general job board engines, niche industry websites and completing HR interviews.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>I created a "Cleantech Job Search Survey" in order to understand student's job process, the resources they used, their search engine preferences, and what features of job search engines they value most. I distributed the google form to a wide range of Berkeley environmental clubs as well as across California universities such as Stanford, UC Berkeley, Scripps, and CalTech. In total, I received more than 100 responses!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h1>IMAGe of script/qs asked</h1>

				<p>My other teammates and I also collected data from students through case study interviews, as well as interviewed a variety of cleantech-related companies about their HR process. With the student interviews, we delved deeper into their answers on the survey and why they made certain choices in their job search process. We reached out to a range of big and small companies as well as non-profit organizations such as the Sierra Club and Grid Alternatives. Our goal was to understand how they hired young professionals and the role that job boards played in their hiring process.

				<h3>Research Insights</h3>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<img class="img-responsive" src="ctr/results.png" alt="Cleantech Rising">
				<br>
				<p>Based on the surveys that I conducted as well as the work of my teammates interviewing both students and companies, I came up with various insights:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Students demonstrated high interest in the cleantech industry but with relatively low experience, many not knowing where to start searching for a job. Approximately 70% of students were interested in finding summer internships and 57% of students were looking for research opportunities. Nevertheless, more than half of the survey respondents spend between 0-3 hours job searching. </li>
					<p></p>
					<li>Survey respondents were looking for job opportunities in a wide range of fields from engineering to business, software and data science, and product design and law. No category was greater than 25% and 20% of students were unsure of what they wanted to do, yet still expressed interest in cleantech.</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>Some of the pain points that students found were that there was no clear starting point for the job search process and it was intimidating applying to large companies or that they had either incompatible skills or no interest in available jobs. Moreover, most received few responses from recruiters and had no personal contact or visibility. There was also a lack of a centralized platform and location for cleantech related jobs.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>On the hiring side, we learned about the most frequent methods that small companies used to hire young professionals, which was relatively different than the method used by big companies.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Overall the hiring process for younger professionals versus experienced employees is very different. For young professionals, small companies use a range of techniques from job boards, recruiting through LinkedIn, and getting referrals.</li>
				</ol>

			<!-- <h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p> [Give context about why working on this project]</p>

			<h3>Current Implementation</h3>

			<h3>Diverging ideas</h3>
			<p>Project scope:
			Questions to be answered include: 1. what is the job search process and most desired jobs of the target users? what resources can be provided to make talent hunting process easier for cleantech companies? How do we attract more users? ==> determine this through students' survey and interview results as well as company interviews resutls, recommendations</p>

			<p>Potential ideas is looking at new advanced features and implementation with website, creating a mentorship program that will help to attract participatns</p>

			<p> PERSONALIZED JOB BOARD </p>



<p>My solution should serve as a guide for the job search process, include a wide range of opportunities, and be efficient by incorporating features such as easy filtering and favoriting to limit time spend searching for jobs.</p>

<p>Strong interest in cleantech as a whole, need to source from a wide range of industries and provide other resources (ex: mentorship)</p>

<p>Other diverging ideas: mentorship program with young professionals to ask questions about getting experience, what the industry is like, what to highlight on resume = understand career trajectory and get advice. Also resources like resume reviews, networking opportunties.</p>




			<h3>Research Insights</h3>
			<p>Include information on slides</p>

			<p>People that I worked with provided insights about students and companies by synthesizing individual interview responses as well as other teammates that helped synthesize company needs (through HR interviews). Include info on slide about interview methodology here</p> -->
