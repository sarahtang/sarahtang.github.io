		<!-- Row 1: Introduction -->

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>For 5 weeks in the fall of 2017, I was a new Android Developer in Mobile Developers of Berkeley, the premier mobile development club at UC Berkeley. During my first semester in the club, I consolidated my Android development training and worked <b>to improve how grocery shoppers keep track of their foods and expiration dates</b>.</p>

				<p> Preserve is a mobile application that allows users to keep track of when their foods will expire. The app makes handling expiration dates faster and easier with OCR technology that scans receipts while also providing timely notifications.</p>

				<p>My role in this project was to think through the flow of the app, prototype, create the UI/UX designs and implement them using Android Studio. I worked with Eric Kong, Sumukh Shivakumar, and Julia Luo to implement this project!</p>

				<!-- THE PROBLEM -->
				<h3>The Problem</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p> At UC Berkeley, on one day, students threw away more than 450 pounds of food, the equivalent of 400 meals. Food waste is a problem: it's wasteful and resource intensive. After grocery shopping, refrigerators are crowded with food, making it difficult for students to keep track of when an item expires. <b>However, a user's experience of adding food expiration dates into a mobile app is tedious and time intensive.</b> The goal of this project was to improve this process so that users would have a more enjoyable and reliable experience inputting and managing food expiration dates. While promoting sustainability!</p>
			</div>
		</div>


		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h3>Research</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>I began to tackle this project by first <b> conducting competitive analysis in order to understand how other mobile food tracking apps approach inputting food expiration dates</b>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>Additionally, I interviewed Cal undergraduate students regarding their grocery shopping experience. I wanted to analyze how students living in both dormitories and apartments <b> approached the entire food experience from grocery shopping, unpacking groceries, cooking, and discarding old produce</b>.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h3>Research Insights</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>From both user research and through competitive analysis, I established the following key ideas that guided both my team's construction of the mobile app and my design process.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Students live with multiple people, ranging from 4 to 5 other students in their apartment. As a result, refridgerators are easily crowded and older foods get pushed to the back and forgotten in the process.</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>There is no physical method that many users use to track their expiration dates. Instead they rely on memory. However, as I learned in <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> by Don Norman, expiration dates are likely stored in short term memory as it is currently being used. <b>However, this type of information is for everyday tasks that span longer periods, rending our working memory inefficient for remembering food expiration dates</b>.</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>All other food expiration tracking services <b>require users to manually add each individual food item in order to receive timely notifications</b>. This includes both the name of the item and the corresponding time the item expires.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<h3>Ideation</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>The design implication of these insights is to put the knowledge, in this case the food expiration dates, into the world. This removes the need for users to keep this information in their head, while making people more accurate. At the same time, people need to be reminded at the correct time, otherwise the stored information is not useful.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>The major design deirections that I considered were <b>expediting the food expiration input process, using a food expiration API to create smart notifications, and creating an interface that clearly showcases the items the user wants to see</b>.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>At this point in the process, some of the challenges that my team ran into were:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>We were unable to find a usable food expiration API. Without this resource, how should we collect expiration dates of items without making the user input the date each time? How do we create smart predictions?</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>Should there be receipt scanning in the food collection process, and what would that experience be like? How would users edit text if the OCR technology failed?</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>Off of the last point, how do we handle unstandardized conventions of writing food items on receipts? Does this affect the scanning?</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

				<h3>Narrowing Project Scope</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>Based on our competitors and the feasibility of certain features, our team decided on the direction for the Preserve mobile app. <b>As the most widespread issue with the user experience was tediously adding each individual food item, we decided to implement receipt scanning and explore the experience of scanning receipts and automatically adding those food items</b>.</p>
			</div>

				<h3>Sketches</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>Beginning work on the main screen of the app, I sketched out different ways of organizing food items based on their attributes - name, expiration date, category, and storage location.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

				<i><span>Initial sketches for fridge screens and incorporation of features.</span></i>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>While working on these sketches, I aimed to address the issues I found during the research process. <b> I worked to make deleting food items at once easy and intuitive, food items and expiration dates more apparent, and detailed various ways to organize and display the information to make the food items that were going to expire noticeable.</b></p>

				<p> The next step was to think about marketing and the banner that we would use to display our app at the Mobile Developers of Berkeley (MDB) app fair as well as on the Play Store. We started off with a simple banner shown below.</p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="preserve/banner.png" alt="banner">
			</div>


			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p>However, I knew that I wanted to elevate our design to further illustrate what our app does and add more dimension. Therefore, I redesigned the banner to include perishable foods with exclamation marks as a nod towards our use of notifications as well as a receipt because of our OCR receipt scanning.</p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="preserve/marketing.png" alt="marketing">
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p>After this first round of design, our app needed a redesign. My goal was to make the app look more simple and sleek, in terms with Google's <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a> specifications. Also, based on the features of our app, the user experience could be simplified to better highlight our main features. I experimented with different login and sign up screens as well as main screens because this is where the user first interacts with the app. It was important especially for the fridge to keep it simple in solely displaying the name and expiration date of the item. Overall, the app gained a cleaner aesthetic that made it clearer to use.</p>

				<h3>TAKEAWAYS</h3>
				<p>Overall, this project was a great way for me to incorporate all aspects of what I enjoy: conservation, computer science and design. By creating an app that helps to reduce food waste, I really found a way to combine my interests. I was a part of every stage of the process from ideation, design, development, and redesign. I definitely learned a lot by working with a team and making compromises when discussing certain features or design initiatives. Additionally, as part of this team, we learned how to  play to each other's strengths. Specifically for me, I spearheaded all design aspects of the app. The most important thing was figuring out part of the design process: iterating multiple times and truly figuring out how your users use the app to create a better experience for them. </p>
