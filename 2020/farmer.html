			<p> Covid-19 completely altered my plans for the summer of 2020, but I was lucky to find a job at a restaurant, something that I've always wanted to do. I worked at the Farmer & the Fish as garde manger, which means that I was tasked with preparing and plating cold dishes, mainly salads and appetizers, as well as desserts. The feeling of touching food and being a part of a person's experience at the restaurant was really appealing. During my time there, I not only learned a lot about how kitchens are run, but also how food is cooked, prepared, and plated.</p>
			<p> This was my first time working with food in a restaurant setting and it was an amazing experience. I pickled red onions, made dressings like lemon aioli while also learning about emulsifications, plated dessert platters, tasted new foods like black garlic, worked the hot wing and seared scallops, and also felt the high of a dinner rush. It was fast paced and rewarding and I am so grateful for the experience.</p>

			<p> Working at a farm-to-table restaurant was a great way to feel in-touch with where our food came from. In the summer, there were tomatoes and eggplants. It was fun seeing how our menu changed to incorporate the influx of produce coming from the farm. From specials to changing sets, we had farm-fresh sungold tomatoes, beets, summer squash, patty pans, basil, chives, lettuce, frisée, gooseberries, radishes, eggplants, hakurei turnips, and more. I also got to see the root cellar and how we smoked our own bacon and ribs.</p>

			<p>I made hundreds of lobster rolls, ladled out bowls on bowls of clam chowder, and prepped countless quarts of house dressing. I cooked family meals and participated in cooking competitions with (and won against)  the sous chef and the owner.</p>

			<p> Thanks to all of the people who made this experience so memorable. Thanks for answering my questions, teaching me how to cook and the science behind food processes, and telling bad dad jokes. Working with Chef Kevin O'Neil and the rest of the kitchen team was such a pleasure and I am very appreciate for all of their support.</p>

			<p>Overall, covid-19 enabled me to pursue a dream of working with food and learning about an industry that I previously knew nothing about. This experience was truly a silver lining and am grateful for everything I learned, the people I met, and the food I ate. I now need to figure out how to incorporate food, local produce, and sustainability into my future!</p>
