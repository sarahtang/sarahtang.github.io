			<h2>Iceland</h2>
			<h6>4 days along the Ring Road + 1 day in Reykjavík</h6>

			<br>

			<p> Iceland is an absolutely stunning country, based on the small glimpse I got of it. Every destination is unique and the south side has stops for glaciers and geysers and is lined with waterfalls. I really enjoyed getting outside and hiking around, after traveling throughout Europe and staying in major cities. Consider how much time you want to spend at each destination and make sure to leave enough time to explore, otherwise your road trip will be spent mostly in the car.</p>

			<p> Logistically, food is expensive. To keep your budget low, make a grocery run before heading out on the Ring Road and stock up on sandwich materials,fruit and snacks to tide you over. We also bought pasta for dinner for the nights we were staying in hostels or AirBnBs with kitchens. There are lots of places to stay along the Ring Road, and we opted for cheaper hostels in our own private bedroom.</p>
